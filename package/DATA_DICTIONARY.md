The flag is therefore always evidence-linked; the 12 v1.1 samples that carried both an in-scope and an out-of-range age were resolved in favour of the archive attribute (reasons in `value_history.parquet`, `change_stage = auditor_review:B9`) |

## study_metadata_wide.parquet
| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `study_accession`, `study_title`, `n_samples`, `n_runs`, `first_public_min` | archive identity and size |
| `catalog_status`, `triage_verdict`, `decision_stage`, `confidence`, `evidence` | inclusion verdict and its evidence |
| `universe_slice` | enumeration channel that found the study |
| `recov_age`, `recov_delivery`, … | recoverability tier predicted before extraction (R1 archive / R2 table / R3 paper / R4 abstract / R0 none) |

| `cohort_id`, `cohort_name`, `n_linked_papers`, `linked_pmids` | cohort and literature |
| `n_unique_infants_est` | distinct resolved `subject_key` among `role = infant` samples — populated only when `n_unique_infants_source ∈ {subject_ids, subject_ids_partial}`; NaN otherwise (v1.2; v1.1 wrote 0 or n = n_samples sentinels) |
| `n_unique_infants_source` | `subject_ids` (every infant sample has a resolved subject and subjects repeat), `subject_ids_partial` (subjects resolved on part of the infant samples), `subject_ids_all_distinct` (one subject id per sample — cannot distinguish cross-sectional from unresolved; render "≤ n"), `no_subject_evidence` (render "unknown (≤ n)"), `no_infant_role_samples` |
| `n_unique_infants_upper`, `n_unique_infants_display` | upper bound (number of infant-role samples) and the string the site should render |
| `n_infant_role_samples`, `n_infant_samples_with_subject` | inputs to the above |
| `n_infant_evidenced`, `n_study_all_infant`, `n_age_unknown_mixed_study`, `n_age_unknown_no_study_estimate`, `n_adult_flagged`, `n_non_infant_role`, `n_age_scope_infant` | per-study `age_scope` counts; `n_age_scope_infant` = infant_evidenced + study_all_infant |
| `mixed_age_deposit` | True when more than half of the study's sample rows are `age_unknown_mixed_study` or `adult_flagged` — render a banner |
| `n_samples`, `n_runs`, `n_biosamples` | from `runs.parquet`: runs of the study; distinct BioSamples; `n_samples` = runs for run-unit studies, else BioSamples. `n_sample_rows` = rows of the sample table keyed to this study (differs when a BioSample carries runs from two BioProjects; `n_biosamples_shared_with_other_study`) |
| `longitudinal`, `max_timepoints`, `n_mothers` | subject resolution (infant-role samples) |
| `worklist_rank`, `effort_class` | curation priority |
| `ena_url`, `ncbi_url` | links |

## Sample unit (added after the auditor's run-vs-BioSample finding)
| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `biosample_accession` | str | always populated: the BioSample (SAMN/SAMEA/SAMD) — equals `sample_key` for `biosample` rows, `parent_biosample` for `run` rows |
| `run_accession` | str | populated only for `run` rows (equals `sample_key`); null otherwise. Sandpiper/run-level joins: `COALESCE(run_accession, runs.run_accession)` |
| `age_scope` | str | `infant_evidenced` · `study_all_infant` · `age_unknown_mixed_study` · `age_unknown_no_study_estimate` · `adult_flagged` · `non_infant_role` — see README "Age scope and roles". Precedence: adult_flagged > non_infant_role > infant_evidenced > study_all_infant (n_infant_samples_est ≥ 0.9 × n_infant_scope_samples) > age_unknown_mixed_study (estimate below 0.9) > age_unknown_no_study_estimate (triage gave no estimate) |
| `age_scope_basis` | str | the concrete evidence behind `age_scope`: `age_at_collection_days<=1100`, `preterm_status`, `gestational_age_weeks`, `subject_has_infant_evidence`, `committed age >1100 d`, `role … from …`, or the study ratio used |
| `sample_unit` | `biosample` (default: one BioSample = one stool), `run` (child row: the submitter registered one BioSample per infant and one run per stool — 6 studies, 521 rows), `biosample_pooled` rows were moved to `parent_biosamples.parquet` in v1.2 — the sample table contains only `biosample` and `run` units |
| `parent_biosample` | for `run` rows, the pooled BioSample they belong to |
| studies.`n_samples` | catalog sample rows (biosample + run units); `n_biosamples` keeps the archive's BioSample count (e.g. PRJNA294605: 158 samples, 11 BioSamples) |

Class-A decision rule (deterministic, `sample_unit_classification.csv`): BioSample text says 'Assembly of N … samples'/'pooled', or a run-keyed supplementary table gives ≥2 distinct ages/timepoints across the BioSample's runs, or NCBI BioSample carries a collection-date range. Technical multi-run BioSamples (lanes, replicates, paired/unpaired, long+short reads; 33 studies) keep the BioSample as unit.


## Confidence (v1.2 clarification)
`confidence` (and every `<field>__confidence`) is an **ordinal reliability tier assigned by the route and engine that produced the value, not a calibrated probability**. Deterministic R1 parsers emit 0.90 (title parser 0.70, unit resolution 0.75–0.85, date arithmetic 0.85, subject propagation 0.70–0.85); R2 table extraction emits 0.65–0.85 (0.75 typical, 0.85 when a paper's own table maps by exact run/sample accession); R3 paper-text group statements 0.25–0.80 (Opus-downgraded statements are capped at 0.40); R4 abstract statements 0.40–0.50. The full tier list is `confidence_tiers.csv` (route × determiner × scope, with the discrete values emitted). The empirical precision of each tier against the curatedMetagenomicData gold join is in `tier_field_precision.csv` (`gold_set = hires` excludes gold rows whose age is an integer number of years; `all` is the full 3,670-sample join; value mapping: cMD c-section subtypes → `c_section`, `No Breastfeeding`/`Exclusively Formula Feeding` → `formula`; age tolerance max(7 d, 10 %); GA ± 1 wk). On that join the tiers are monotone for age (R1 0.90 → 1.00, R1 0.85 date/propagation → 0.70, R2 0.85 → 1.00, R2 0.75 → 0.98) but not for feeding (R2 0.75 → 0.48, R2 0.85 → 0.94), and no gold exists for R4 or for exposure fields — treat the number as a tier label and read the precision table for the field you use.

## parent_biosamples.parquet
The 16 BioSamples that the submitters of 6 deposits registered one-per-infant with one run per stool. Their runs are the catalog's `run` sample units (`n_child_run_units`, `child_run_units`). Same columns as the sample table plus `n_determinations_moved` (their 97 v1.1 determinations are in `value_history.parquet`, status `moved_to_parent_biosamples`). Excluded from every count.

## study_verdict_history.parquet
One row per (study, stage table, replicate). `stage_order` (v1.2.1) follows the stage ontology `stage_rank`/`stage_level`: screen < tier1_rubric < confirm r1–r3 < adjudication < growth_wave (wave order ff, gap, grow, grow_w2, grow_w3, gsa, loose, nm, r3, v3_delta; r1 < r2 < wave adjudication) < growth_wave_merged < biosample_rejudge < human_review (round 1, round 2) < consolidated_triage_v2 < consolidated_final; ties broken by date, replicate, stage. `is_consolidated` marks rows copied from a consolidated table (`consolidated_kind` = final / triage_v2 / growth_wave) — render only the `final` row as the single 'final' line. `verdict_norm` (v1.2.1): Haiku screen `yes` → `uncertain` (screen-pass, not a verdict), `no` → `exclude`, `ERROR` and empty verdicts → null; `verdict_norm_note` explains each mapping. `stage_family` groups tables (haiku_screen, sonnet_rubric_tier1, sonnet_confirm:*, opus_adjudication:*, growth_triage_merged:*, biosample_rejudge, human_review_round1/2, triage_v2_consolidated, catalog_final). `verdict` is the raw label of that stage (include/exclude/unsure/uncertain; the Haiku screen's yes/no; `ERROR` for failed requests); `verdict_norm` maps it to include/exclude/uncertain/None. `is_final` marks the row that equals `universe_studies_all`. `evidence` is the stage's JSON evidence list; `src_artifact`/`src_version_id` name the release-bundle table the row was copied from.

## value_history.parquet
Determinations that are not in `sample_determinations.parquet`. `status`: `superseded` (a higher-precedence value replaced it; `replaced_by` names it), `rejected` (validator or rule rejection; `reason`), `dropped` (group statement failed the Opus checklist audit; `reason` = drop_reason), `recommitted_out_of_scope_adult` (an R1 age the v1.1 validator rejected as out of range that v1.2 commits with `parse_note out_of_scope_adult` to evidence `adult_age_flag`), `not_committed_duplicate` (second out-of-range age attribute on the same sample), `moved_to_parent_biosamples`, `auditor_finding_applied` (study-level auditor findings and what was done). `change_stage` names the pipeline stage that made the change (`auditor_review:B2`/`B9` for v1.2.0; `auditor_review:R3-3` for the v1.2.1 host/isolate rule, statuses `recommitted_out_of_scope_host` and `recommitted_out_of_scope_isolate`, field_name `body_site_class`, evidence source `run.scientific_name` / `run.library_source`).


## Release columns (R2026.1, package 1.3.0)
Fact tables — `sample_determinations.parquet`, `universe_studies_all.parquet`, `study_metadata_wide.parquet`, `cohorts.csv`, `study_paper_links.csv`, `sandpiper_sample_summary.parquet`, `sandpiper_run_qc.parquet`, `sandpiper_top_genera.parquet`, `sandpiper_study_panels.parquet`, `study_metadata_wide.csv` — end with three columns:

| column | dtype | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `release_added` | string | release in which this row first became visible (`R<YYYY>.<n>` or a pre-numbered package semver `1.0.0`–`1.2.2`); pre-1.3.0 values are reconstructed — see DATA_DICTIONARY 'Release columns' |
| `release_retired` | string \| null | release that replaced/removed the row; null (empty in CSV) = current row |
| `package_added` | string | semver of the data package in which the row first appeared |

Release ids are `R<YYYY>.<n>` (first: `R2026.1` = package 1.3.0) or, for states published before numbering, the package
semver `1.0.0` (first public package, 2026-09-25), `1.1.0` (release v11), `1.2.0`, `1.2.1`, `1.2.2`. "Current" = `release_retired IS NULL`;
in the shipped fact tables every row is current. `sample_metadata_wide` is derived from `sample_determinations` and carries no release columns.

**Reconstruction caveat.** Packages before 1.3.0 carried no release columns, so `release_added` of pre-existing rows was reconstructed:
newest `value_history.change_stage` touching the (sample_key, field_name) or `sample_determinations.src_track`, mapped to the package the
CHANGELOG records for that stage (`sample_unit_fix` → 1.1.0, `auditor_review:B2`/`B9` → 1.2.0, `auditor_review:R3-3` → 1.2.1,
`owner_decision` → 1.2.2). Exact for rows those stages touched (13191 current determinations:
`src_track = sample_unit_fix` → 1.1.0, `src_track = adult_scope_fix` → 1.2.0); every other pre-1.3.0 row is labelled `1.0.0` by assumption
(the first package is not archived as a table, so this cannot be verified row by row). `package_added` equals `release_added` for all
pre-1.3.0 rows. Study verdict rows are all `1.0.0` (no verdict change is dated after the first package); Sandpiper rows are `1.2.0`
(when Sandpiper landed; the v1.2.1 recomputation of existing rows is recorded in the CHANGELOG, not as retire+add).

## sample_determinations_all.parquet (R2026.1)
`sample_determinations` columns + the three release columns + `retired_reason` (string|null; `value_history.reason`) +
`retired_change_stage` (string|null; `value_history.change_stage`). Rows: every current determination (618,898,
`release_retired` null) ∪ every **retired published value** (1,316) reconstructed from `value_history`
rows whose `status` ∈ {`superseded`, `moved_to_parent_biosamples`, `recommitted_out_of_scope_host`, `recommitted_out_of_scope_isolate`}
(`release_retired` = the package of their `change_stage`). value_history rows with status `rejected`, `dropped`, `not_committed_duplicate`,
`recommitted_out_of_scope_adult` (the pre-history of a row that IS current) or `auditor_finding_applied` were never published and are not
rows here. Exactly one current row per (`sample_key`, `field_name`); retired rows may repeat a key. `sample_determinations_superseded.parquet`
(223 rows) is the same set as the `superseded` rows of stages `sample_unit_fix` (75) and `auditor_review:B9` (148) and is kept for the v1.1 layout.

## releases.csv (R2026.1)
One row per release id, oldest first: `release_id`, `package_version`, `release_date`, `data_tag`, `site_tag`, `doi` (empty until Zenodo
mints one), `n_studies_included`, `n_samples`, `n_catalog_scope`, `n_determinations_current`, `sandpiper_version`, `notes_file`. Historical
rows carry only the counts the CHANGELOGs state (empty otherwise — never invented).

## Contribute worklist (R2026.2, package 1.4.0)
`contribute_worklist.csv` — one row per **open** study (`universe_studies_all.triage_verdict ∈ {include, uncertain}` and at least one of the
six worklist fields below 0.5 coverage on its catalog_scope samples; studies with 0 catalog_scope samples are judged on body-site scope
`body_site_class ∈ {primary, unknown}`). Complete studies are not listed. Rules, templates and vocabularies: the pipeline's
`config/contribute.yaml` and `docs/CONTRIBUTE.md`. Read-only: nothing here is a curated value — every column is derived from the tables
of this package and from the recoverability / R2-rescue / supplement-inventory artifacts registered in `config/inputs.json` (group `contribute`).

**Blocker codes** (one per study, decision order = listing order for included studies; uncertain studies always `archive_only_uncertain`):
`controlled_access` (study/cohort in the controlled-access registry) · `no_linked_paper` (0 rows in study_paper_links) · `paywalled_abstract_only`
(extraction_worklist access_tier C/D/E) · `tables_unjoinable_need_key` (R2 rescue: supplementary tables keyed by paper-internal names) ·
`pdf_only_supplement` (only PDF/DOCX supplements) · `no_supplement_found` (paper but no inventoried supplement) · `unitless_age_needs_curator`
(age column without unit) · `partial_coverage` (paper + tables processed, fields still missing). Field-level code `complete` = field at/above threshold.
**Contribution types**: `per_sample_table`, `id_key`, `paper_pointer`, `age_schedule`, `verdict_evidence` (dropdown of the GitHub Issue form
`catalog-contribution.yml` that `issue_url` opens prefilled). Rows get `release_retired` when the study becomes complete in a later release.

## Registry tier (R2026.4, package 1.6.0)
The registry is the **outer tier** of the catalog (docs/EXPANSION.md): every ENA study with a human shotgun-metagenome signal, any body site,
any age, classified at STUDY level from ENA study/sample/run metadata (no paper reading). Enumeration slices: S1 `library_source=METAGENOMIC` ×
`WGS|WXS`; S2 misfiled `GENOMIC` on verified human-metagenome taxa; S3 `OTHER|Targeted-Capture|WGA` adjudication (per-slice completeness in
`registry_universe_audit.csv`). Classification stages: `deterministic_prior` (infant-universe verdict carried over), `deterministic_rule`,
`sonnet_x2` (two rubric replicates agree), `opus_adjudicated` (replicates disagreed → adjudication), `pending`. Vocabularies: the pipeline's
`config/vocab/{body_sites,life_stages,assay,population_flags}.yaml`; scope rules: `config/scope.yaml`. The curated infant catalog is the scope
`infant_gut` inside this registry (`in_infant_catalog` mirrors `universe_studies_all.triage_verdict`). The run-level table `registry_runs.parquet`
(all runs of the universe, 46 ENA fields + `found_by`) is attached to the GitHub Release of the data repository as `registry_runs_v<version>.parquet`
(too large for this package). Bitemporal columns follow the package convention (`release_added`, `release_retired`, `package_added`).

## Sandpiper columns (added v1.2.0)
Source: SingleM community profiles from Sandpiper 2.0.0 (Woodcroft et al. 2025, *Nat Biotechnol*; Zenodo record 20419175, CC-BY), taxonomy GTDB R232. Profiles are keyed by run; for a catalog sample with several profiled runs the filled coverage per taxon is **summed across runs and then normalised** (never averaged). Every `*_ra` column is a **fraction of prokaryotic (Bacteria + Archaea) coverage** — approximately a cell proportion, not a read fraction; not comparable with MetaPhlAn or 16S numbers.

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `sp_profiled` | True when at least one run of the sample has a Sandpiper profile |
| `sandpiper_url` | `https://sandpiper.qut.edu.au/run/<run>` — the RANDOM-selection profiled run with the highest root coverage (v1.2.1) |
| `sp_n_runs_total`, `sp_n_runs_profiled`, `sp_partial` | run counts; `sp_partial` = some runs unprofiled |
| `sp_spf` | prokaryotic read fraction (%), metagenome-size-weighted over runs |
| `sp_known_species_fraction` | % of prokaryotic coverage assigned to a named GTDB species |
| `sp_root_coverage` | summed root coverage (× genome equivalents); `sp_low_depth` = root < 2× (bars hidden) |
| `sp_top_genus`, `sp_top_genus_ra` | most abundant genus-level bin (may be `unassigned_at_genus`) |
| `sp_ra_g_Bifidobacterium` | GTDB `g__Bifidobacterium` (stable genus) |
| `sp_ra_f_Bacteroidaceae`, `sp_ra_g_Bacteroides`, `sp_ra_g_Phocaeicola` | GTDB moved *B. vulgatus/dorei/plebeius/coprocola* to *Phocaeicola*; the family ≈ NCBI-sense *Bacteroides* |
| `sp_ra_enterobacterales_core` | Σ of six GTDB genera incl. their alphabetic-suffix genera (`^g__<Name>(_[A-Z]+)?$`): Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter(+_B,_D), Citrobacter(+_A = amalonaticus/farmeri, _B = koseri, _C, _D), Salmonella, Serratia(+_B,_G) (GTDB `f__Enterobacteriaceae` is broader than NCBI's, so the family is not used) |
| `sp_ra_g_Escherichia`, `sp_ra_g_Klebsiella`, `sp_ra_f_Lachnospiraceae`, `sp_ra_f_Lactobacillaceae` (GTDB splits *Lactobacillus*), `sp_ra_g_Streptococcus`, `sp_ra_g_Staphylococcus`, `sp_ra_g_Enterococcus`, `sp_ra_g_Veillonella`, `sp_ra_g_Clostridioides` (*C. difficile*) | indicator taxa |
| `sp_ra_unassigned_genus` | coverage not resolved to a genus (novel fraction; never renormalised away) |
| `sp_shannon_genus`, `sp_n_genera_ge1pct` | Shannon (ln) over genus bins incl. the unassigned bin; named genera ≥ 1 % |
| `sp_flag_low_complexity` | Sandpiper low-complexity rule — expected for Bifidobacterium-/Enterobacterales-dominated neonatal stool; display only, never triage |
| `sp_nonmeta_class`, `sp_flag_non_metagenome`, `sp_flag_synthetic`, `sp_flag_rna`, `sp_flag_readfraction_warning` | see **sandpiper_flag_table.csv** (single source for field, site label, definition, level; `sandpiper_flag_definitions.json` is generated from it). `sp_flag_non_metagenome` = `sp_nonmeta_class ∈ {named_nonhuman_host, named_microbe_or_other}` over the sample's runs (v1.2.1) |
| `sp_run_concordance_bc`, `sp_runs_discordant` | max pairwise genus-level Bray–Curtis between the sample's runs; discordant = BC > 0.5 (human-review hint, not a verdict) |
| `taxonomy_db`, `taxonomy_version`, `sandpiper_version` | GTDB / R232 / 2.0.0 on every profiled row |

### GTDB alphabetic-suffix genera (v1.2.1, R3-1)
Every genus indicator matches `^g__<Name>(_[A-Z]+)?$`, i.e. the GTDB genus **and** its alphabetic-suffix split genera, so that the NCBI-sense genus is covered. `gtdb_to_ncbi_note` per indicator:

| indicator | GTDB taxa summed | gtdb_to_ncbi_note |
|---|---|---|
| `sp_ra_g_Bifidobacterium` | g__Bifidobacterium | single GTDB genus; equals NCBI Bifidobacterium |
| `sp_ra_g_Bacteroides` | g__Bacteroides, g__Bacteroides_D, g__Bacteroides_E, g__Bacteroides_F | Bacteroides_D/_E/_F are NCBI Bacteroides species split by GTDB (e.g. B. pectinophilus) |
| `sp_ra_g_Phocaeicola` | g__Phocaeicola, g__Phocaeicola_A | Phocaeicola_A added; the family f__Bacteroidaceae ≈ NCBI-sense Bacteroides |
| `sp_ra_enterobacterales_core` | g__Citrobacter, g__Citrobacter_A, g__Citrobacter_B, g__Citrobacter_C, g__Citrobacter_D, g__Enterobacter, g__Enterobacter_B, g__Enterobacter_D, g__Escherichia, g__Klebsiella, g__Salmonella, g__Serratia, g__Serratia_B, g__Serratia_G | includes Citrobacter_A (amalonaticus/farmeri), Citrobacter_B (koseri), Enterobacter_B/_D, Serratia_B/_G; Escherichia includes NCBI Shigella |
| `sp_ra_g_Escherichia` | g__Escherichia | GTDB Escherichia includes NCBI Shigella |
| `sp_ra_g_Klebsiella` | g__Klebsiella | single GTDB genus |
| `sp_ra_g_Streptococcus` | g__Streptococcus | single GTDB genus in this dataset |
| `sp_ra_g_Staphylococcus` | g__Staphylococcus | single GTDB genus in this dataset |
| `sp_ra_g_Enterococcus` | g__Enterococcus, g__Enterococcus_A, g__Enterococcus_B, g__Enterococcus_C, g__Enterococcus_D, g__Enterococcus_E, g__Enterococcus_F, g__Enterococcus_G, g__Enterococcus_H, g__Enterococcus_I, g__Enterococcus_J, g__Enterococcus_K, g__Enterococcus_L | includes GTDB Enterococcus_A (avium/raffinosus/gilvus), _B (faecium/lactis/hirae/durans), _C (asini/dispar), _D (gallinarum/casseliflavus), _E (cecorum), _F … _L; plain g__Enterococcus = E. faecalis group |
| `sp_ra_g_Veillonella` | g__Veillonella, g__Veillonella_A | includes Veillonella_A (seminalis/ratti and unnamed species) |
| `sp_ra_g_Clostridioides` | g__Clostridioides | single GTDB genus (C. difficile) |

Placeholder genera: GTDB R232 contains alphanumeric placeholder genera without a Latin name, e.g. `g__ECMA0423` (Enterobacteriaceae; one species, detected in ~34 % of profiled samples at ~0.25 % mean RA) and `g__G047199095`. They are real GTDB genera, appear in `sandpiper_top_genera.parquet` and in study panels under their placeholder name, and are **not** counted in any named indicator column. Bifidobacterium species shares (`share_within_bifidobacterium`, off-package table) are normalised over **named species only**; in ~20 % of samples > 10 % of genus coverage is unresolved at species rank, so shares overstate named species — use `sp_ra_unassigned_species` as the denominator caveat.

`<field>__scope` (16 coverage fields): scope of the winning determination — `sample`, `subject`, `biosample` (propagated from a parent BioSample) or `group` (R3/R4 statement applied to a defined group). Apply the README reading rule to `group`-scope values.

Study columns `sp_*`: `sp_frac_samples_profiled` = profiled rows / `n_sample_rows` (one denominator, v1.2.1); `sp_median_*` are computed over **panel-scope** rows (`catalog_scope` ∧ profiled ∧ NOT `sp_low_depth`) and are null with `sp_panel_scope` giving the fallback label when a study has none; `sp_frac_runs_flagged` counts runs whose organism label is a non-human host or a named microbe, or synthetic / RNA (the routine "Homo sapiens" host label is *not* counted). `sp_auditor_attention`/`sp_auditor_reason`: the Sandpiper track's hint that a study deserves a human look (never a verdict).

## Author columns (added v1.2.0)
`authors.parquet`: one row per study × author × paper (`author_display`, `author_surname`, `author_initials`, `is_group`, `source` ∈ linked_paper / bioproject_publication / ena_study_xref, `pmid`, `doi`, `position`, `n_authors`, `is_first`, `is_last`, `paper_relation`, `catalog_status`). `study_authors_summary.csv`: per screened study `first_author`, `last_author`, `n_authors`, `n_papers`, `organisations` (ENA centre / broker and NCBI BioProject owner names, `;`-joined). Names are string-matched from Europe PMC `authorString`; the same person may appear under several initial variants and no disambiguation was attempted.

## sandpiper_run_qc.parquet (documented v1.2.1)
One row per run of the 389 included studies (174,022 rows). Keys: `run_accession`, `study_accession`, `sample_accession` (BioSample), `catalog_sample_key` (sample-table key), `sample_unit` (`biosample` / `run` — v1.2.0 wrote the retired value `biosample_pooled` for the 521 run-unit runs; renamed in v1.2.1 so a join on `sample_unit = 'run'` works).

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `in_sandpiper` | True when the run has a profile in the Zenodo snapshot |
| `sp_miss_reason` | why not (precedence v1.2.1: strategy → platform → access → horizon → size → snapshot gap): `profiled` · `non_wgs_strategy` (library_strategy in {AMPLICON, Targeted-Capture, WXS} — the strategies with zero profiled runs in the snapshot; OTHER and WGA are profiled by Sandpiper and are not miss reasons) · `non_illumina_platform` · `controlled_access_study` · `published_after_snapshot_horizon` · `unknown_size` (ENA base_count ≤ 0, so size cannot be judged) · `small_run_lt_100Mbp` · `ena_illumina_not_in_snapshot` / `sra_illumina_not_in_snapshot` / `ddbj_illumina_not_in_snapshot` (eligible by every rule but absent from the snapshot) |
| `library_strategy`, `library_source`, `instrument_platform`, `base_count`, `first_public`, `organism` | ENA run/sample fields used by the rules |
| `sp_root_coverage`, `sp_species_coverage` | root / species-level coverage (genome equivalents) |
| `top1_order_fraction`, `top3_order_fraction` | share of coverage in the top 1 / top 3 orders (low-complexity inputs) |
| `sp_spf`, `sp_known_species_fraction` | prokaryotic read fraction (%), known-species fraction (%) |
| `bacterial_archaeal_bases`, `metagenome_size`, `average_bacterial_archaeal_genome_size` | Sandpiper size estimates (bases) |
| `sp_warning_present` | Sandpiper emitted a warning for the run |
| `sp_prediction`, `sp_host_or_not` | Sandpiper ecological prediction and host-associated call |
| `sp_nonmeta_class` | organism-label class: `not_flagged` · `named_human_host` · `named_nonhuman_host` · `named_microbe_or_other` (see sandpiper_flag_table.csv) |
| `sp_flag_*`, `sp_low_depth`, `sp_predicted_ecological`, `sp_low_known_species_high_depth` | run-level flags — every one is defined in **sandpiper_flag_table.csv** |
| `sandpiper_url`, `sandpiper_version`, `taxonomy_db`, `taxonomy_version`, `zenodo_record` | provenance (Sandpiper 2.0.0 outputs, Zenodo 20419175, GTDB R232; the live Sandpiper site may show a newer version) |

## sandpiper_study_panels.parquet (v2, v1.2.1)
Mean relative abundance per study over **panel-scope rows** = `catalog_scope` ∧ `sp_profiled` ∧ NOT `sp_low_depth` (top-12 phyla, top-15 genera, plus the `unassigned_at_*` bins with `rank_order = 0`). Columns: `study_accession`, `rank`, `taxon`, `mean_rel_abundance`, `n_samples_panel` (rows averaged; asserted equal to the recomputation from the shipped sample table), `rank_order`, `n_samples_study` (rows of the study), `n_catalog_scope`, `n_profiled`, `n_profiled_catalog_scope`, `n_profiled_age_infant` / `n_profiled_age_adult` / `n_profiled_age_unknown_or_other` (age_scope breakdown of all profiled rows, for the caption), `n_low_depth_excluded_from_panel`, `frac_samples_profiled`, `panel_scope`, `panel_definition`, `taxonomy_db`, `taxonomy_version`. Studies without panel-scope rows have **no rows** here; their fallback label is in `sandpiper_study_panel_status.csv` and in `study_metadata_wide.sp_panel_scope`. The v1.2.0 merge artefacts `n_samples_x`/`n_samples_y` are gone.

## sandpiper_flag_table.csv (v1.2.1)
Single source for every Sandpiper flag: `field`, `level` (run / sample / study), `site_label`, `definition`, `used`. `sandpiper_flag_definitions.json` is generated from it; the GlobDB domain-only flags are kept with `used = false` (the catalog uses GTDB profiles only).

## organisations.parquet (v2, v1.2.1) and study_authors_summary.csv
One row per study × organisation token × source (`bioproject_organization` = NCBI BioProject Organization, `submitter_center` = ENA center_name, `ena_broker`). v1.2.1 adds `not_org_reason` (`submission_id` for `^SUB\d+( \| SUB\d+)*$`, `email_or_handle` for tokens containing `@`, `placeholder` for n/a / None / '.', `lowercase_username` for single all-lowercase tokens such as `hpsun`), `is_organisation` (not_org_reason is null; such rows get `org_type = not_an_organisation`) and `display_eligible` (is_organisation AND, for PRJNA studies with an NCBI BioProject organisation, not an ENA center_name). `organisations_index.json`, `study_authors_summary.organisations` and `study_metadata_wide.organisations` are built from `display_eligible` rows only; a check asserts that no published organisation string matches `SUB\d{6,}` or contains `@`. Single lowercase tokens include some genuine company/institute acronyms (e.g. novogene, rivm) — they stay in the parquet for owner whitelisting but are not displayed.

`authors.parquet` (v2): `author_key` folds names with a transliteration map (ø→o, æ→ae, ß→ss, ł→l, đ→d, İ→i, Ð→d, Þ→th) before NFKD stripping, and folds initials too; the group regex includes office / production / editorial; `name_needs_check` flags no-initials multi-token person names for manual review.
